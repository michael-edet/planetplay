                        Planet Play represents a unique convergence of musical vision and technological 
                        innovation. Originally conceived by Michael Edet in early 2024 as a personal 
                        promotional initiative to elevate his musical career, the platform's potential 
                        quickly transcended individual aspirations.

                        Recognizing the universal challenges artists face in achieving digital visibility, 
                        Michael—a programmer by training—envisioned a more sophisticated solution. This 
                        vision led to a strategic collaboration with Ekemini Edet, forming a partnership 
                        that would transform Planet Play from a simple promotional concept into a 
                        comprehensive digital ecosystem powered by advanced software solutions.
